# authGeneration
A NPM package that allows the generation of API Keys and other sorts of auth generation

I wanted to create a package that would allow my GoLang and NodeJS projects generate API keys so I created this package. There is another package that wrote in GO 
that has the logic so that I can do the same thing for my backend GoLang projects.

API Key Generation:

  Its relatively simple function that will return a API in this format: xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxx-xxxxxx. Uses the current Date and Math.Random to do most of the heavy lifting here. 
  

JWT Generation:

  TODO
  
  
NPM Link:
